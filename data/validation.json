Electrolysis reactions typically involve the decomposition of a liquid due to the passage of an electric current, which is unrelated to the chemical changes observed in the video.

When the phone is placed inside a closed cardboard box lined with aluminum foil, the interference is significantly reduced. However, when the phone is placed inside a wire mesh cage with large gaps, the interference is not significantly reduced. The aluminum foil-lined box effectively attenuates electromagnetic waves due to its continuous conductive layer that reflects and absorbs radiation. In contrast, the wire mesh cage's large gaps allow radiation to pass through, reducing its effectiveness in blocking interference. Thus, the continuous barrier of the foil is more efficient for electromagnetic shielding compared to the gap-laden mesh."

When humans come into contact with water infected by schistosomes, the cercariae penetrate the skin, lose their tails, and transform into schistosomula. A few days later, schistosomula enter small veins or lymphatic vessels, migrate to the right side of the heart, then to the lungs, and finally reach the hepatic sinusoids, where they begin to mature. Once mature, the adult worms pair up and migrate to their final habitat. There, the eggs deposit in small veins of the intestines or bladder, passing through the submucosa and mucosa into the lumen and are expelled through feces or urine, completing the life cycle. Schistosomiasis can lead to Symmers' fibrosis, which is option C."
